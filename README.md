# 💫 About Me:

Hey there! 👋 I’m a first-year Computer Science student currently training like a young Avenger 🦸‍♀️ — building skills, solving problems, and preparing for bigger missions (projects).
I code in **C++** and **Python**, and like Tony Stark said: *"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk."* 🚀
My GitHub is my Stark Lab 🛠️ — experiments, projects, and a little chaos.

Let’s assemble and build something awesome together! 💥
